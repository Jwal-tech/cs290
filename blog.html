<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>
  This assignment felt very much like the easy beginner assingment one takes to ease oneself into the workflow of the term.
  With just using html tags, the actual file editing was nothing new to me and was accomplished relatively quickly. However, I did
  learn some useful tricks concerning how to use Git well. I installed Git Desktop to make it much easier to clone repositories
  as well as make new commits that will no doubt help me down the line with further assignments.
